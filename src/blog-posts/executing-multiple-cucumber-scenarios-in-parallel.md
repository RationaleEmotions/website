To the best of my knowledge, so far thereâ€™s no support within cucumber-jvm so as to support concurrent executions of scenarios that are part of a particular feature file.

I have attempted at taking a jab at this problem and am glad to announce a Proof Of Concept in that direction.

I have named it as Road Runnerâ€¦ **Beep beep** ðŸ™‚
