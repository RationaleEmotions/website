# Working with @TestInstance annotation

Sometimes one would need to gain access to the test class instance to which an `@Test` annotated test method belongs to, from within a data provider. This could be particularly useful in cases, wherein the data provider may need to behave differently based on the type of the class to which the `@Test` method belongs to.

This is where the `@TestInstance` annotation from TestNG comes into picture. This annotation is typically used on the parameter of a data provider method.

Hereâ€™s a sample data provider.

```java
public static class LocalDataProvider {
    @DataProvider (name="data-provider")
    public static Object[][] getData(@TestInstance Object object) {
        System.err.println("The instance passed in was " + object.getClass().getCanonicalName());
        return new Object[][] {
            {1},
            {2}
        };
    }
}
```
Here are two test classes that make use of the above cited data provider.

**First test class**

```java
public static class FirstTestClass {
    @Test (dataProvider="data-provider", dataProviderClass=LocalDataProvider.class)
    public void testmethod(int number) {
        System.err.println("Value = " + number);
    }
}
```

**Second test class**

```java
public static class SecondTestClass {
    @Test (dataProvider = "data-provider", dataProviderClass=LocalDataProvider.class)
    public void testmethod(int number) {
        System.err.println("Value = " + number);
    }
}
```

Now when you run both the above mentioned test classes, you should see an output as below :

```
